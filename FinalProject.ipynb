    "\n",
    "#### EVAN LAUFER (A14941886) Performed statistcal analysis for traffic volume and number of accidents and injuries. Calculated pearson correlations. \n",
    "#### MOHAMMED RAHMAN (A12719779) Found the collisions dataset and performed the time analysis for accidents over time.\n",
    "#### MOHIT GURUMUKHANI (A14345340) Worked with Google's API to do Geocoding for the heat map. Also helped with cleaning of traffic volume dataset.\n",
    "#### SHAHERYAR AJMAL (A92115270) Did the data cleaning, wrangling, and visualized the heat maps and found most dangerous roads based on accident and injuries.\n",
    "#### YINHE LU (A92112347) Performed the time analysis for month and helped with the presentation."

    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From the poor amount of lighting in the neighborhood of La Jolla, to the narrow one way streets of Downtown SD, there are numerous concerns for drivers in San Diego to make it a safer place for drivers and pedestrians alike. Our final project revolves on the following question, \"Are streets in San Diego with higher traffic volumes more dangerous?\". We defined dangerous in two ways: number of accidents and number of injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this issue, we examine a dataset that contains police reports of collisions that have happened in San Diego County over the past few years, and perform various analyses on these reported collisions. These police reports give details such as time and day of the incident, what street(s) the incident took place at, and a standardized description of the incident. We also wanted to see how related car accidents and injuries were to traffic volume, so we looked at the traffic counts dataset, which is a data set that contains the number of cars that drove through any particular street section on a given date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that streets with higher traffic volumes will experience more car accidents with more injuries, whereas the null hypothesis would be that streets with higher traffic volumes have less accidents with less injuries."

We also created a script that would find the top ten types of traffic violations associated with every street, so we could see why so many accidents were happening.

We also changed streets that have numbers on them such as \"01\" to \"01ST\".  Also, some of the traffic counts for specific directions were listed as NaN.

This makes sense because if a type of accident occurs more frequently, then there would be more injuries associated with that accident. However, some types of accidents might not result in much injury as compared to others. For example, driving on the wrong side of the highway will have much more injuries associated with it than not using turn signals. This explains the few outliers."

    "After we find out the correlation between time of day and the number of collisions, we still need to consider if there is any correlation between time of the year and the number of the collisions. We first take out the time of the day from the time list so that we can focus on only the month data. Then we use value_counts() method to caculate whats the number of collisions and put them in a list following the order from January to December. Then we plot the dataframe to get the bar chart of the dataset. We can see there is a significant spike of incidence happened in January which has a total collision of 2392 but the rest of the year remain consistent. This can give us a potential correlation between month of the year and number of collisions."

    "We can see through the data that the month of January has some of the largest number of accidents. There could be a multitude of reasons for this. Moreover, we see that there tends to be a higher number of accidents during rush hour. There are more injuries and accidents on roads that are close to the highway, but there also happen to be a large number of accidents in urban areas, such as cities or shopping centers. \n",

    "We believe that there needs to stricter enforcement of turning signals, speed laws, and stop signs, especially near urban areas and close to highways. This is because these accidents are associated with greater amounts of injuries. Moreover, Garnet Avenue needs to have more police officers on it because it has an abnormally high number of injuries per accident. "
