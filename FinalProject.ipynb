    "Our final project revolves on the following hypothesis, \"What can we do to make San Diego a safer place for drivers?\". From the poor amount of lighting in the neighborhood of La Jolla, to the narrow one way streets of Downtown SD, there are numerous concerns for drivers in San Diego to make it a safer place for drivers and pedestrians alike. \n",
    "To approach this issue, we examine a dataset that contains police reports of collisions that have happened in San Diego County over the past few years, and perform various analyses on these reported collisions. These police reports give details such as time and day of the incident, what street(s) the incident took place at, and a standardized description of the incident. "

This makes sense because if a type of accident occurs more frequently, then there would be more injuries associated with that accident. However, some types of accidents might not result in much injury as compared to others. For example, driving on the wrong side of the highway will have much more injuries associated with it than not using turn signals. This explains the few outliers."

The interval between 12:00am and 3:00am is still notable and might suggest incidents of sleeping behind the wheel, DUIs, or poor lighting of streets as well."

    "After we find out the correlation between time of day and the number of collisions, we still need to consider if there is any correlation between time of the year and the number of the collisions. We first take out the time of the day from the time list so that we can focus on only the month data. Then we use value_counts() method to caculate whats the number of collisions and put them in a list following the order from January to December. Then we plot the dataframe to get the bar chart of the dataset. We can see there is a significant spike of incidence happened in January which has a total collision of 2392 but the rest of the year remain consistent. This can give us a potential correlation between month of the year and number of collisions."
