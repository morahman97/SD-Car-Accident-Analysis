    "#### EVAN LAUFER (A14941886) Performed statistcal analysis for traffic volume and number of accidents and injuries. Calculated pearson correlations. \n",
    "#### MOHAMMED RAHMAN (A12719779) Found the collisions dataset and performed the time analysis for accidents over time.\n",
    "#### MOHIT GURUMUKHANI (A14345340) Worked with Google's API to do Geocoding for the heat map. Also helped with cleaning of traffic volume dataset.\n",
    "#### SHAHERYAR AJMAL (A92115270) Did the data cleaning, wrangling, and visualized the heat maps and found most dangerous roads based on accident and injuries.\n",
    "#### YINHE LU (A92112347) Performed the time analysis for month and helped with the presentation."

    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From the poor amount of lighting in the neighborhood of La Jolla, to the narrow one way streets of Downtown SD, there are numerous concerns for drivers in San Diego to make it a safer place for drivers and pedestrians alike. Our final project revolves on the following question, \"Are streets in San Diego with higher traffic volumes more dangerous?\". We defined dangerous in two ways: number of accidents and number of injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this issue, we examine a dataset that contains police reports of collisions that have happened in San Diego County over the past few years, and perform various analyses on these reported collisions. These police reports give details such as time and day of the incident, what street(s) the incident took place at, and a standardized description of the incident. We also wanted to see how related car accidents and injuries were to traffic volume, so we looked at the traffic counts dataset, which is a data set that contains the number of cars that drove through any particular street section on a given date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that streets with higher traffic volumes will experience more car accidents with more injuries, whereas the null hypothesis would be that traffic volume does not affect the number of accidents or injuries."

We created scripts that would find the number of accidents and injuries associated with every street name and for every type of traffic violation. We also calculated the injury per accident ratio for every street name and violation type. We also created a script that would find the top ten types of traffic violations associated with every street, so we could see why so many accidents were happening. We put all of this information into two data frames, one for streets and another for traffic violation types. The street dataframe would would contain number of accidents, injuries, and ratio for every street and the violation dataframe would contain all of that information for every violation type.\n",

We also changed streets that have numbers on them such as \"01\" to \"01ST\".  Also, some of the traffic counts for specific directions were listed as NaN. The NaN's indicated that no traffic was counted on those roads. We changed all of those NaN's to be listed as zero. \n",

This makes sense because if a type of accident occurs more frequently, then there would be more injuries associated with that accident. However, some types of accidents might not result in much injury as compared to others. For example, driving on the wrong side of the highway will have much more injuries associated with it than not using turn signals. This explains the few outliers."

The interval between 12:00am and 3:00am is still notable and might suggest incidents of sleeping behind the wheel, DUIs, or poor lighting of streets as well."

    "After we find out the correlation between time of day and the number of collisions, we still need to consider if there is any correlation between time of the year and the number of the collisions. We first take out the time of the day from the time list so that we can focus on only the month data. Then we use value_counts() method to calculate whats the number of collisions and put them in a list following the order from January to December. Then we plot the dataframe to get the bar chart of the dataset. We can see there is a significant spike of incidence happened in January which has a total collision of 2392 but the rest of the year remain consistent. This can give us a potential correlation between month of the year and number of collisions."

For the ethics regarding the outcome of this project, this project purely seeks to visualize and understand accident patterns in San Diego, and could be used to show means of improving driving safety in the city.

    "There is indeed a noticeable correlation between traffic volume as well as number of incidents, and the Pearson coefficient calculated above shows this as well. As part of our exploratory analysis we noticed that there are two streets in particular that are exceptionally dangerous, which are Garnet Ave and Ocean View Blvd. The R-squared value generated from number of injuries to traffic count with the outliers is 0.620, and the R-squared value generated without the outliers is 0.836. The high R-squared indicates a strong relationship between injuries and traffic volume. Moreover, the R-squared value between the number of accidents and traffic volume is 0.795 which shows also shows a strong relationship between car accidents and traffic volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the outliers, which are Garnet Ave and Ocean View Blvd, are two streets had an abnormally high amount of people injured per accident. They also had a abnormally number of injuries to traffic volume. This may be due to the fact that these two streets are in dense areas with a vibrant night life (Garnet Ave is in Pacific Beach, and Ocean View Blvd is in Downtown SD). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation between traffic volume and number of accidents is 0.892, and the correlation between traffic volume and number of injuries is 0.915. This shows a strong positive, linear relationship between the traffic volume and our definition of dangerous, which includes number of accidents and number of injuries. From these results, we can see that this proves our hypothesis."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that there needs to stricter enforcement of turning signals, speed laws, and stop signs, especially near urban areas and close to highways. This is because these types of violations are associated with greater amounts of injuries. Moreover, Garnet Avenue and Ocean View Boulevard needs to be more regulated to minimize injuries. We also believe that there needs to be more crowd control to split up traffic between roads. If a road has less traffic, then there would be less injuries. Shifting traffic to different roads would help make the streets of San Diego a safer environment to drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important idea to discuss in particular is the potential this project has for improving the safety of San Diego. If brought to the attention of government officials that work with the city, specifically in the transportation department, they can benefit from this analysis and determine the best course of action to take in improving traffic flow and safety in the various streets of San Diego. Another possible idea would be to implement GPS systems with an awareness of accident rates for various streets, to keep drivers alert in particularly dangerous areas. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death for Americans, and our study can be a stepping stone towards solving this issue."
